The R file initially reads [Tetuan City power consumption.csv](https://github.com/NiladriMallik/EDA-in-R/blob/master/Tetuan%20City%20power%20consumption.csv). 

The dataset is cleaned and saved as [output Tetuan City power consumption.csv](https://github.com/NiladriMallik/EDA-in-R/blob/master/output%20Tetuan%20City%20power%20consumption.csv).

This cleaned dataset is used throughout the code.

These are some of the visualizations created.
